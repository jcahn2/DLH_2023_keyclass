`KeyClass` is a general weakly-supervised text classification framework that learns from *class-label descriptions only*, without the need to use any human-labeled documents. It leverages the linguistic domain knowledge stored within pre-trained language models and the data programming framework to assign labels to documents. We demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of our method by comparing it to state-of-the-art weak text classifiers across four real-world text classification datasets.

## Overview of Methodology

</p>

**Figure.1** From class descriptions only, KeyClass classifies documents without access to any labeled data. It automatically creates interpretable labeling functions (LFs) by extracting frequent keywords and phrases that are highly indicative of a particular class from the unlabeled text using a pre-trained language model. It then uses these LFs along with Data Programming (DP) to generate probabilistic labels for training data, which are used to train a downstream classifier [(Ratner et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723)

**Table 1.    Classification Accuracy.** `KeyClass` outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on 4 real-world text classification datasets. We report our modelâ€™s accuracy with a 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. Results for Dataless, WeSTClass,
LOTClass, and BERT are reported from [(Meng et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07245).

## Tutorial
To familiarize yourself with `KeyClass`, please go through the following [tutorial](https://github.com/autonlab/KeyClass/blob/main/tutorials/Tutorial%20on%20IMDB.ipynb) which trains a text classifier from scratch on the DBpedia dataset.

<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation

All models were built and trained using PyTorch 1.8.1 using Python 3.8.1. Experiments were carried out on a computing cluster, with a typical machine having 40 Intel Xeon Silver 4210 CPUs, 187 GB of RAM, and 4 NVIDIA RTX2080 GPUs.

Setup the environment with the following steps: 

``` bash
$ conda create -n keyclass python=3.8
$ conda activate keyclass
$ conda install -c pytorch pytorch=1.10.0 cudatoolkit=10.2
$ conda install -c conda-forge snorkel=0.9.8
$ conda install -c huggingface tokenizers=0.10.1
$ conda install -c huggingface transformers=4.11.3
$ conda install -c conda-forge sentence-transformers=2.0.0
$ conda install jupyter notebook
```
Alternatively, we have also provided the conda .yaml file, so the environment can be recreated using the following steps:
```
$ conda env create -f scripts/environment.yaml
$ conda activate keyclass
```

<a id="reproduce"></a>
## Reproducing Results in [Classifying Unstructured Clinical Notes via Automatic Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12088.pdf)
To reproduce the results in our paper, run the following commands. 
```
$ cd scripts
$ bash get_data.sh
$ python run_all.py --config../config_files/config_imdb.yml
$ python run_all.py --config../config_files/config_agnews.yml
$ python run_all.py --config../config_files/config_dbpedia.yml
$ python run_all.py --config../config_files/config_amazon.yml
```
Additionally, we release our [pretrained models](https://github.com/autonlab/KeyClass/releases/tag/v1.0). Please see the tutorial notebook above on evaluating trained models.
